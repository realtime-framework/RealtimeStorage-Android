## Realtime Cloud Storage Android SDK
Part of the [The RealtimeÂ® Framework](http://framework.realtime.co), the Realtime Cloud Storage Service is a highly-scalable backend-as-a-service powered by Amazon DynamoDB. We've added real-time notifications to keep data synchronized between users of your application.

	        exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE'
	        exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE'
